NAME

    Task::PerlCriticAllPolicies - A Task for installing all Perl::Critic
    policies at once.

DESCRIPTION

    This Task is for installing all Perl::Critic policies at once.

    Note that you probably do not want to install this directly on your
    workstation. Policies effect perlcritic globally and may directly
    conflict with each other in terms of their rules.

    This Task is useful for prepraing a CI system that runs perlcritic for
    multiple perl projects and therefore need to support different set of
    profiles. A scenario that basically requires everything to be
    installed.

    Those project-specific perlcritic profiles also need to contain the
    "only=1" flag in order to select exactly the one that applies.
